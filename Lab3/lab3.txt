/usr/bin/ls has this issue. The coreutils version is coreutils 8.22

Got the warning: this key is not certified with a trusted signature;
There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
This is probably due to the web of trust where the signed key was
put in the `unknown' trust group. This is a useful feature of RSA

Running `make install' was not successful since it tried installing
coreutils in /usr/local/bin to which we don't have access to.

Running the executable `ls' in coreutils-8.29/src/ produces
the bug from the message board when we run ls -aA.

Commands I used to patch:
patch --dry-run -ruN -p1 -d coreutils-8.29 < 0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch
patch -ruN -p1 -d coreutils-8.29 < 0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch

File `NEWS` failed to patch. My guess is that the patcher
worked in two directories `a' and `b' as seen in the diff
output from the patch file.

Commands I ran to remake coreutils:
autoreconf -fi
make
Running `make' recompiles all the .c files for executables in src/ and tests/.

`ls' is patched now: `A' flag now overrides `a' flag in `ls -aA'.
