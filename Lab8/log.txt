I used a computer running Ubuntu as I had
compatibility issues with Beaglebone and my
Windows.

I saw that Ubuntu had XOrg is running in
the background, but I decided to install
a backup X-server application.

I ran START.html and installed any drivers/
software needed. Then I ssh'd into my Beagle:

$ ssh -X root@192.168.7.2

I then configured my Beagle to connect to a
mobile hotspot my partner setup by running:
$ connmanctl
connmanctl> enable wifi
connmanctl> scan wifi
connmanctl> services
connmanctl> agent on
connmanctl> connect <hotspot-string>
passphrase: ********
connmanctl> quit

We then grabbed each others' local ip
address by running $ifconfig and looking
for `inet address'

I created an account for my partner by
executing:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/max -m max
$ sudo passwd max

I then entered Max's home directory and
created the `.ssh' profile:
$ cd /home/max
$ sudo mkdir .ssh
$ sudo chown -R max .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Finally I entered my partner's Beaglebone
by running:
$ ssh -X elvis@<max_local_ip>
<entered my password here>

My partner had gedit installed, so I just
ran $gedit, and the gedit window opened.

The second half involved using key pairs
to ssh into a Beaglebone instead of passwords.
I ran:
$ ssh-keygen
$ ssh-copy-id -i elvis@<max_local_ip> # adds public key to server
$ eval $(ssh-agent -s) # initiates ssh-agent.
$ ssh-add # gives private key to ssh-agent instance
$ ssh -X elvis@<max_local_ip>

This time, no password was needed to ssh into
my partner's server. I was able to run gedit
again here.
