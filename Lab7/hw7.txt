(2) git checkout v3.0 -b quote

C-x 4 a to open a ChangeLog buffer. I adapted my log from
the 'v3.0' commit message from git log.

My ChangeLog was:
   * src/cmp.c, src/diff.c, src/diff3.c, src/dir.c:
   * src/sdiff.c, src/util.c:
   Quote 'like this' in output and hard-coded strings

(6)
I first removed untracked files. Then:
git add *
git commit
Then I entered my ChangeLog in

(7) (while in quote) git format-patch master
This generated a file like 0001-XXXXX.
I renamed it to formatted-patch.txt.

(8) git checkout master
git checkout v3.0 -b partner
git am partner-formatted-patch.txt

This is what I found as the latest merge
not newer than 2015-01-25:

    Merge branch 'master' into xwidget
    SHA ID: d522fd8ca73e668bfafd0419bc5f71f2751cca24
    
The top 3 windows describe the commits with branches and merges,
authors, and date of commit in reverse chronological order

The bottom left section shows the commit message with
SHA ID's of parent and child commits, along with all
changes in that commit.
The window to the right are bookmarks to files in the
difference output window.
