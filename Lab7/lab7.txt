I used vc-revert (C-x v u) to revert all changes
to all non .c files.

I used vc-diff and used C-c C-c while in that
buffer to examing source code, and C-c C-a to
undo changes from a specific hunk.

Here are the .c files I modified.
# denotes that all changes were undone
* denotes that some (not all) were undone
src/
	analyze.c (#)
	cmp.c (*)
	context.c (#)
	diff.c (*)
	diff3.c (*)
	dir.c (*)
	ifdef.c (#)
	io.c (#)
	sdiff.c (*)
	side.c (#)
	util.c (*)

(10) I manually looked at Rej and added
the necessary changes. Only diff3 and diff
had to be changed I think.

git clean -n # dry-run
git clean -f # actual

326 lines in quote-3.0-patch.txt

(13) I worked in lnxsrv09
./bootstrap
patch -rRej -uN -p0 -d ./ < ../lab/diffutils-gets.diff
./configure
make
make check # I encountered errors with src/sh I think.
# But diff works fine.

Yes, there are differences between the two
diff files, but they are innocuous since
the actual changes to the source code in
both files are identical - which is needed
to patch.
