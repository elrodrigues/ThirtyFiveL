1) tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
This command converts any character that
is not a the Englist alphabet into newlines

2) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]'
This command does the above but removes
repeated sequences of newlines leaving one

3) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort
This command does the above but sorts
the words in ASCII order

4) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u
This command does the above but sorts the
words uniquely in ASCII order

5) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm - words
This command does the above and creates
three columns of words.

6) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -23 - words # ENGLISHCHECKER
This command does the above but only
outputs the words that are not in the `words` file.

The script to build the Hawaiian dictionary is below:
sed -r 's/<u>|<\/u>|\?//g' | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' | \
tr '\`' "'" | grep -e "<td[^>]*>" | \
sed -r 's/^\s*(<.*)$/\1/g' | sed -r 's/<[^>]*>//g' | \
sed '/^$/d' | sed '0~2d' | sed '1,2d' | \
sed 's/\s/\n/g' | sed '/^$/d'

This first removes <u>, </u> and ? tags. Then, it converts
all letters to lower-case and graves (`) to apostrophes (').
It then looks for the words using the <td> tag. Then, it gets
rid of extra spacing at the start and removes all <td> and </td>
tags. Finally, it gets rid of empty lines and deletes alternating
lines leaving us with the Hawaiian words.

HAWAIIANCHECKER commands:
1) tr -cs "PKMNWLHAEIOUpkmnwlhaeiou'" '[\n*]' < assign2.html| \
tr [:upper:] [:lower:] | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | wc -l
Distinct misspelled words using HAWAIIANCHECKER is 232 words.

2) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | \
comm -23 - words | wc -l
Distinct misspelled words using ENGLISHCHECKER is 94 words

3) tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | \
comm -23 - words | tr -cs "PKMNWLHAEIOUpkmnwlhaeiou'" '[\n*]'| \
tr [:upper:] [:lower:] | sort -u | comm -12 - hwords | wc -l
Number of distinct words that ENGLISHCHECKER reports
as misspelled but HAWAIIANCHECKER does not: 10
lau, wiki are two examples

4) tr -cs "PKMNWLHAEIOUpkmnwlhaeiou'" '[\n*]' < assign2.html| \
tr [:upper:] [:lower:] | sort -u | comm -23 - hwords | \
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' | sort -u | comm -12 - words | wc -l
Number of distinct words that HAWAIIANCHECKER reports
as misspelled but ENGLISHCHECKER does not: 123 words
alone, all are two examplesca

I have two bugs in poornames. One is when the name starts
with a character that must be escaped in sed. The other
is when the directory cannot be opened. The script continues
to work but it cannot (for now) redirect this error to stderr.
