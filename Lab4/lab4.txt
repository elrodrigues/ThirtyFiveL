==NOTES==
Encountered an error during `make' where two functions both
named `futimens' had conflicting types. This is where the
renaming patch would come in.

Used this command to patch coreutils:
patch -ruN -p0 -d coreutils-with-bug < coreutils.diff

In the temporary folder, wwi-armistics-cs35l is shown to have
modified date of 1918 when running the SEASnet and bugged
version of ls. However, attempting the same thing in the home
directory outputs a modified date of 2054.

This is probably due to the difference in way time is stored
in local temporary folders as opposed to the home directory.
Running SEASnet's ls technically sorts the output correctly,
but incorrectly judges wwi-armistice-cs35l to be from 2054.

==PATCHING==
I first ran into issues patching coreutils since files like
utimens.c~ do not exist from the untar'd version. I then
learnt to use the flag `-p0' to deal with this.

I used gdb to debug ls.c and found that its main function
made calls to `compare_mtime()' when the `-t' flag was used.
With iterative steps and breaks, I finally found calls to
`timespec_cmp()' in `timespec.h' where the issue seemed
to originate.

Using the test example from the spec, two calls are made
every run to timespec_cmp(), and in the second call, we
can find an overflow of the variable `diff' to a negative
number since wwi-armistice-cs35l is so far back in time.

I resolved this issue by changing timespec_cmp() to a
simple comparison to avoid overflow and underflow issues.

I generated my patch using the command:
diff -u timespec.h~ timespec.h > lab4.diff
Where `timespec.h~' is the original header file.
